## Dataset Overview

This dataset contains details about health insurance policyholders and their associated medical costs. Key columns include:

* **age**: Age of the individual
* **bmi**: Body Mass Index
* **children**: Number of dependents covered
* **smoker**: Smoking status
* **region**: Residential region in the US
* **charges**: Medical expenses billed by insurance

## Project Objective

The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict medical charges based on an individual's profile. By analyzing patterns in the data, we aim to understand which factors have the greatest impact on healthcare costs.

## Methodology

The project will follow a structured pipeline that includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature processing, and model development. We'll encode categorical data, scale numerical features, and experiment with regression models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting to find the best-performing one.

## Real-World Relevance

A reliable prediction model can help insurers better estimate premiums, assist healthcare providers in planning budgets, and enable individuals to anticipate potential medical expenses. By applying machine learning, the project aims to support more data-driven decisions in the healthcare and insurance industries.
